						<h2>Media Sharing Web Application using AWS</h2>
						<p>The Media Sharing Web Application using AWS is a web application that allows users to upload, share and display images in a gallery format. The web app was developed using Python programming language and Streamlit web framework. The application uses Amazon S3 for storing and retrieving images and Amazon DynamoDB for managing metadata and information about the uploaded images.</p>
						<p>The application was designed with scalability and reliability in mind. To achieve this, the application was deployed on AWS EC2 instances with load balancing. Load balancing ensures that the incoming traffic to the web app is distributed evenly across multiple instances, which helps to avoid any one instance becoming overwhelmed with traffic.</p>
						<p>Using AWS S3 for storage provides reliable and durable object storage that is scalable and cost-effective. This allows the application to store large amounts of image data without the need for complex on-premises storage infrastructure. Additionally, Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic.

						</p>
						
						<h2>Containerizing an Application and Operating it using AWS</h2>
						<p>In this project, I containerized a Python application using Docker and pushed the image to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR). I then deployed the application on AWS EC2 instances with a load balancer to ensure scalability and consistency. By containerizing the application, I was able to create a portable and isolated environment for the application to run, making it easier to deploy and manage. Using AWS EC2 instances with a load balancer allowed me to automatically distribute incoming traffic to multiple instances, ensuring that the application can handle high volumes of requests and that there is no single point of failure. Overall, this project demonstrated how containerization and AWS services can be used to create a reliable and scalable application infrastructure.

						<h2>Router Configuration Management using GitHub</h2>
						<p>The Router Configuration Management using GitHub project was developed to automate the tedious task of configuring routers in a GNS3 lab setup. By leveraging Python libraries and a network automation tool, the configuration process was streamlined and made much more efficient. In addition, the project was designed to back up the running-config file to a GitHub repository, providing a secure and reliable method for storing configuration files. The use of GitHub allowed for easy collaboration and version control among team members. Overall, this project helped to reduce the workload of network administrators and improved the efficiency and reliability of router configuration management.



						</p>

						<h2>Asterisk Server</h2>
						<p>In this project, I demonstrated my ability to set up and configure an Asterisk server to enable communication between different SIP clients on different IP addresses. To showcase my proficiency in virtual machine networking, I used two different virtual machines running SIP phones and set up the necessary network configurations to establish communication between them using the Asterisk server. This involved configuring the virtual network interfaces, assigning IP addresses, and configuring the Asterisk server to route the SIP traffic between the two virtual machines. Overall, the project demonstrated my skills in network configuration, virtual machine networking, and VoIP technologies.



						</p>

						<h2>Virtual Networking (PfSense)</h2>
						<p>In this project, I utilized my skills in virtual networking to create a web page on a virtual machine installed on VirtualBox using an Apache web server. To enable access to the web page from the host machine, I configured port forwarding on a pfSense router.</p>
						<p>I leveraged my knowledge of networking protocols and network security to ensure that the virtual machines and the network were secure and isolated from external threats. I also utilized my skills in Linux server administration to configure and manage the virtual machines effectively.</p>
						<p>Overall, this project showcased my ability to set up and manage complex virtual networking environments, including configuring routers, virtual machines, and web servers, as well as ensuring network security and isolation.</p>
